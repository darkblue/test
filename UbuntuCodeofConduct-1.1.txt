= Ubuntu Code of Conduct v1.1 =

This Code of Conduct covers our behaviour as members of the Ubuntu
Community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel,
install-fest, public meeting or private correspondence.  Ubuntu
governance bodies are ultimately accountable to the Ubuntu Community
Council and will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member
of the community.

      '''Be considerate.''' Our work will be used by other people, and
      we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take
      will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those
      consequences into account when making decisions.  Ubuntu has
      millions of users and thousands of contributors. Even if it's not
      obvious at the time, our contributions to Ubuntu will impact the
      work of others.  For example, changes to code, infrastructure,
      policy, documentation, and translations during a release may
      negatively impact others' work.

      '''Be respectful.''' The Ubuntu community and its members treat
      one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable
      contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but disagreement
      is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all
      experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
      frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to
      remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
      threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the
      Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with other
      contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project and
      with users of Ubuntu.

      '''Be collaborative.''' Collaboration is central to Ubuntu and to
      the larger free software community.  This collaboration involves
      individuals working with others in teams within Ubuntu, teams
      working with each other within Ubuntu, and individuals and teams
      within Ubuntu working with other projects outside. This
      collaboration reduces redundancy, and improves the quality of our
      work. Internally and externally, we should always be open to
      collaboration. Wherever possible, we should work closely with
      upstream projects and others in the free software community to
      coordinate our technical, advocacy, documentation, and other work.
      Our work should be done transparently and we should involve as
      many interested parties as early as possible.  If we decide to
      take a different approach than others, we will let them know early,
      document our work and inform others regularly of our progress.

      '''When we disagree, we consult others.''' Disagreements, both
      social and technical, happen all the time and the Ubuntu
      community is no exception. It is important that we resolve
      disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help
      of the community and community processes. We have the Technical
      Board, the Community Council, and a series of other governance
      bodies which help to decide the right course for Ubuntu. There are
      also several Project Teams and Team Leaders, who may be able to
      help us figure out the best direction for Ubuntu. When our goals
      differ dramatically, we encourage the creation of alternative sets of
      packages, or derivative distributions, using the Ubuntu Package
      Management framework, so that the community can test new ideas and
      contribute to the discussion.

      '''When we are unsure, we ask for help.''' Nobody knows
      everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the Ubuntu
      community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road,
      and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked questions should
      be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must
      be taken to do so in an appropriate forum.

      '''Step down considerately.''' Members of every project come and
      go and Ubuntu is no different. When somebody leaves or disengages
      from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that they do so in a
      way that minimises disruption to the project. This means they
      should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to
      ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

We pride ourselves on building a productive, happy and agile community
that can welcome new ideas in a complex field, and foster collaboration
between groups with very different needs, interests and goals. We hold
our leaders to an even higher standard, in the Leadership Code of
Conduct, and arrange the governance of the community to ensure that
issues can be raised with leaders who are engaged, interested and
competent to help resolve them.
